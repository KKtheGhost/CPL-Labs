The escape sequences used in string constants are also legal in character constants,
    so '\n' stands for the value of the newline character, which is 10 in ASCII.
  You should note carefully that '\n' is a single character, and in
            expressions is just an integer; on the other hand, '\n' is a
     string             constant that happens to contain only one character. 
The topic of strings versus characters is discussed further in Chapter 2.\\t
