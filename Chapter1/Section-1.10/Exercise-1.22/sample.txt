Aurangzeb, often described as the "last effective Mughal emperor" ruled India for nearly 50 years from 1658 to 1707,but he was never a favourite in the eyes of historians.
For a start, he came to the throne after imprisoning his father and having his older brother killed.
And in comparison with other Mughal rulers, he fared badly. His great-grandfather Akbar was described as the benign secular ruler, grandfather Jahangir was known for his love for art and architecture and father Shah Jahan was the great romantic who built the Taj Mahal.
But Aurangzeb, the sixth emperor and a devout Muslim, was often described as a ruthless tyrant who was an expansionist, imposed tough Sharia laws and brought back the discriminatory jizya tax that Hindu residents had to pay in return for protection.
He was also described as someone who hated music and other fine arts, and ordered the destruction of several temples.
